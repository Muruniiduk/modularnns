# Modular artificial neural networks

My Bachelor's thesis focused on predicting next frames with the help of natural decomposition of subtasks in the case of a ball bouncing on a virutal "pool table".

## Getting Started

To rerun the simulations with pretrained models, you need to install the requirements and then run the tests.ipynb notebook.

### Prerequisites

TODO: pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Add reqs.txt
```

## Results

TODO: add 3 gifs of 3 models.
